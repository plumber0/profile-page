        Continuously striving to build software that brings value to users
      </h2>
      <p>
        I primarily use Python and have experience with tools like Airflow,
        Django, and FastAPI. Lately, I've been enjoying the use of Pydantic and
        the typing system in Python, and I've written numerous scripts for ETL
        tasks. I have developed serverless applications using AWS Lambda,
        DynamoDB, SQS, and AWS SAM. I've also created a library to help my
        colleagues develop similar applications more quickly. I've built a
        simple service using Flutter and have created a data export web state
        management system using Riverpod. I have also made a basic desktop
        application for data processing. I am always learning new things. This
        website is made purely with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. My main code
        editor is NeoVim, but I also use PyCharm occasionally. I enjoy writing
        code that is easy to understand and modify later. While I don't strictly
        follow Test-Driven Development (TDD), I appreciate the concept of unit
        tests and strive to maintain my test code as much as possible. I value a
        practical approach to coding. I take great satisfaction when users
        benefit from my software. Ultimately, I believe the most important
        aspect of programming is practicality.
